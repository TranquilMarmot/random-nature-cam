# Random Nature Cam

# https://tranquilmarmot.github.io/random-nature-cam

This repo is just an `index.html` that has a script that hits https://explore.org/'s (undocumented) API to get a list of webcams.

It them chooses a random webcam and sets the body of the page to be just a YouTube stream of that webcam.
